# SWAPI Assignment — API Documentation & Bruno Collection

## Overview
This project is part of the Sebes API Specialist test assignment. It demonstrates the ability to explore REST API documentation, execute requests, analyze linked resources, handle errors, create a structured Bruno collection, and publish results in a clear GitHub repository.

## How to Use This Repository

### API Documentation  
See the `docs/` folder for:
- `basic-requests.md` — all required SWAPI requests  
- `error-handling.md` — invalid request example  

### Bruno Collection
`bruno-collection/` contains:
- Basic Requests — the 5 required API calls  
- Error Cases — invalid endpoint example  

Import them into Bruno to run all requests.

## Demonstrated SWAPI Request Flow
1. Get list of characters  
2. Get Luke Skywalker  
3. Get his homeworld  
4. Get a film he appears in  
5. Get a starship from that film  
6. Make and analyze an invalid request  

Each request includes:
- URL & method  
- Purpose  
- Response summary  
- Linked resource explanation  

## Completed Requirements
- All required endpoints explored  
- Five basic requests documented  
- Error request documented  
- Bruno collection structured into folders  
- Repository organized according to specification  
- Clean and clear README.md  

## Notes
- SWAPI uses URL-based links extensively  
- Pagination appears in `/people`, `/planets`, `/starships`  
- 404 returned for incorrect endpoints  
- Bruno helps organize API request collections  

## May the Force be with you.
